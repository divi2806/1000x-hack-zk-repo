## üîç Technical Implementation

### Backend Proxy Architecture

ZKChat implements a smart backend proxy to solve several critical issues:

1. **CORS Protection**: All external API calls are routed through Next.js API routes, eliminating CORS errors
2. **Rate Limit Prevention**:
   - Intelligent request throttling with random delays
   - Strategic caching of API responses to minimize repeat calls
   - Fallback mechanisms when primary API endpoints are unavailable
3. **API Key Security**: API keys stored securely on the server, not exposed to clients
4. **Central Configuration**: Centralized API configuration for easier management

This architecture provides:
- Better user experience with fewer errors
- Improved performance through strategic caching
- Enhanced security by keeping API keys private
- Higher reliability with intelligent fallbacks

### Zero-Knowledge Authentication Flow

1. **Challenge Generation**: Server issues a unique challenge
2. **Proof Creation**: Client generates ZK proof of wallet ownership without revealing the private key
3. **Verification**: Server verifies the proof's validity
4. **Access Granting**: On successful verification, access is granted to appropriate rooms

### NFT-Gated Access Control

1. **NFT Detection**: Helius API checks for specific NFTs in the user's wallet
2. **ZK Proof**: User generates a zero-knowledge proof of NFT ownership
3. **Room Access**: Verified owners gain access to exclusive rooms
4. **Persistence**: Proof results cached for improved performance

### Real-time Messaging Architecture

1. **Message Creation**: Messages created and encrypted client-side
2. **Firestore Integration**: Data stored in Firestore with real-time listeners
3. **Subscription Management**: Efficient subscription handling to prevent memory leaks
4. **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates instantly while confirmations happen in background

### AI Assistant Integration

1. **Command Detection**: @ai commands detected in message input
2. **Context Building**: Relevant chat context sent to Gemini API
3. **Response Generation**: AI generates contextually relevant responses
4. **Response Display**: AI messages styled distinctly in the chat interface

## Zero-Knowledge Proof Implementation

ZKChat uses Helius API for all Solana-related operations, including compressed NFTs and zero-knowledge proofs. This implementation provides real cryptographic privacy and efficiency:

- **Helius API Integration**: Full integration with Helius API for compressed NFT minting, management, and proofs
- **Merkle Proofs**: Using Solana's Merkle tree for cryptographic verification of NFT ownership
- **Real ZK Proofs**: Actual cryptographic verification through Helius's asset proof endpoints
- **Solana Account Compression**: Integration with Solana's native compression system
- **Efficient Storage**: Significantly reduced on-chain storage costs through compression

### How it works

1. **Proof Generation**: When a user wants to prove they own an NFT:
   - The client requests a Merkle proof from Helius for the user's wallet and NFT
   - Helius generates the proof based on the compressed NFT's position in the Merkle tree
   - This proof allows verification of NFT ownership without revealing private keys

2. **Proof Verification**: When verifying NFT access:
   - The server verifies the proof using Helius's verification endpoints
   - The proof is validated against the Merkle tree root
   - Access is granted based on successful verification

This approach leverages Helius's comprehensive API for an end-to-end solution, with Web Crypto API as a fallback for environments where Helius might not be accessible.

### API Caching & Rate Limiting Implementation

ZKChat implements intelligent caching and rate limiting to ensure optimal API usage:

1. **Multi-layered Caching**:
   - Short-term caching (1 minute) for frequently changing data
   - Medium-term caching (5 minutes) for general purpose data
   - Long-term caching (30+ minutes) for rarely changing data like transaction details
 
2. **Adaptive Rate Limiting**:
   - Random jitter added to all API requests to distribute load
   - Configurable cooldown periods between successive requests
   - Intelligent retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Multiple API endpoints for critical operations
   - Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
   - Client-side caching as last resort fallback
